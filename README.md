# MSiA Text Analytics Final Project

This project will explore the combined use of autoencoders and rule-based systems to tag unlabeled data for classification.

The need for labeled data, especially in NLP tasks, cannot be understated. Though unsupervised techniques such as Topic Modeling can help mine insights from unlabeled datasets, in a business context, users often need more fine control over the labels assigned to documents and thus require labels. A common approach is to outsource this labeling to a service such as Mechanical Turk, but even this approach can be inconsistent and insufficient in accuracy. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes a semi-supervised approach in which an expert will define a few simple rules for desired categories, and thene these rules are expanded/augmented by autoencoders to label a greater portion of data. This approach obviously comes with its own limitations, but its performance will be compared to vanilla rule-based systems, MTurk labeled data, and ground truth by evaluating classification models trained on data from each approach.
